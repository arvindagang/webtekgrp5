				<p class="para"><span class="tab">Animal</span> welfare means how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. An animal is in a good state of welfare if 
				(as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well nourished, safe, able to express innate behavior, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states 
				such as pain, fear, and distress. Good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, humane handling and 
				humane slaughter. Animal welfare refers to the state of the animal; the treatment that an animal receives is covered by other terms such as animal care, animal husbandry, and 
				humane treatment. Protecting an animal's welfare means providing for its physical and mental needs.</p>
				<p class="para"><span class="tab">Ensuring</span> animal welfare is a human responsibility that includes consideration for all aspects of animal well-being, including proper 
				housing, management, nutrition, disease prevention and treatment, responsible care, humane handling, and, when necessary, humane euthanasia.</p>
				<p class="para"><span class="tab">There</span> are numerous perspectives on animal welfare that are influenced by a person's values and experiences. There are also various means of 
				measuring animal welfare, including (but not limited to) health, productivity, behavior, and physiological responses.</p>

			<div class="para10" id="para11">
			<p class="para"><span class="tab">It</span> is a means of maltreating any animal either physically or emotionally. it is also a nationwide issue thatâ€™s growing fast in our society. Every year many helpless animals die because of their ruthless owners. There are times that these owners starve, or beat their pet/s. Dogs, Cates, and other animals are also part of this world. They have rights to live freely because God made them. Some animals are considered as pets; and it is more like a companion that will help you emotionally and mentally. The moment you bring them home, whether you bought them somewhere else or even if you just met them outside and suddenly fall for them and start taking care of them, they become a part of your family. Protecting them can be difficult sometimes because you cannot be with them all the time, and considering the growth of animal abuse. Barangay Honeymoon-Holyghost, together with the Veterinary Office of Baguio City, are periodically initiating free vaccines for dogs and cats, and also with the guide of certain republic acts to protect the rights of these animals. The Barangay, with the help of Tanods, also conducts inspection from time to time to check if their residents are responsibly taking care of their pets.</p>
