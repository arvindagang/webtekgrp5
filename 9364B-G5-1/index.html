	<p>Honeymoon Barangay had heightened the advocacy for the promotion of service
	excellence and sustainable development which gears towards the realization of
	our vision-mission statements.</p>
	<p>This year, we have come up with the policies and activities which are undoubtedly considered
	as good investments towards everyone's development. These focus on the protection and welfare
	of the aged and youth inclusive minors, control of peace and order situation, further support
	the government's program on the beautification of the environment, efficient delivery of
	education and public health services, fostering humane working relationship, improvement of
	barangay facilities and other properties and the like through the unceasing support of the
	members of the sangguniang barangay and constituents, the above mentioned programs would
	not be in existence and satisfactory implemented. This present scenario is everyone's
	inspiration and source of strong determination in pursuing our goals in making honeymoon
	barangay a good place to live in, thus instilling the expected values to everybody, as we
	move on to cope with more complex and bague endeavors in the future.<i>&copy;Romulo Leyaley Wayway
