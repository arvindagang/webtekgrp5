						The city government here spearheaded by the city human resource management office conducted a forum on a drug free workplace to some city hall employees last February 23 at the Baguio City multi-purpose hall.

						The forum aims to protect the welfare of the employees against the evil effects of drugs; enhance the level of awareness on drug abuse prevention and control; to update knowledge of employees on the complex issues regarding drug and substance abuse; to help employees to achieve good health, avoid problems of drug abuse and increase safety; to explain how the program can benefit the employees and their family; mitigate the problems of drug abuse in the workplace, in the family and community; and serves as an opportunity for all city hall employees to implement Drug-Free Workplace program geared towards the attainment of a drug-free Philippines.
					</p>

					<p>
						The salient provisions and penalties of Republic Act 9165 and the Civil Service rules and regulations pursuant to article V, section 47 of RA 9165 was given emphasis by information officer Joseph Frederick Calulut of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.						
					</p>

					<p>
						Article V of RA 9165 mandates the promotion of a national Drug-Free Workplace Program with the participation of private and labor sectors and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).

					</p>

					<p>
						 "DepEd is planning to buy science related equipments this year funded by the City Government for the use of the students under the ALS, aside from the fast tracking of additional classrooms and school buildings as part of the K to 12 program of the government ," Martin explained.
