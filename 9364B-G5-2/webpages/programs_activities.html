					<h2> Drug Prevention week activities </h2>

					<p> The local government will spearhead the city’s
						celebration of Drug Abuse Prevention and Control
						Week thru various activities starting November 23.
					</p>

					<p>
						The event is in coordination with the City
						Anti-Drug Abuse Council (CADAC) with councilor
						Roberto Ortega as action officer. The alderman chairs
						the city council’s committee on peace and order and public
						safety.
					</p>

					<p>
						Unveiled in Monday's flag-raising ceremony, the calendar
						of events include a media forum on November 23, 10 am, at
						the city social welfare and development office conference
						hall and a Baguio Emergency Response to Addiction activity
						every Wednesday and Friday, 1 pm, of this month and December
						at the same venue.
					</p>

					<p>
						This month will also see the conduct of an anti-drug
						advocacy campaign in the city’s private and public
						elementary and secondary schools spearheaded by the
						Department of Education-Baguio and Baguio City Police
						Office.
					</p>

					<p>
						A recovery walk from Dontogan to La Presa will be done

						Councilor Ortega's office at City Hall or call 446-9101 
						for more information.
                    </p>

					<p>
						Mayor Mauricio Domogan is urging the public to support the
						activities as his promised mandatory drug tests for all 
						city government workers has been completed and results are
						being awaited.
					</p>

					<p>
						Domogan's push for mandatory drug-testing of all 
						government employees is in support of Pres. Duterte’s 
						on-going campaign against the illegal-drugs menace.

					<h2> DepEd to confuct anti-illegal drug program </h2>
					<p>
						THE BAGUIO Division of the Department
						of Education is set to conduct drug intervention
						programs for the youth.
					</p>

					<p>
						Based on a memorandum of agreement between
						DepEd ,the Baguio City Government and volunteers 
						groups, a series of lectures will be done in various
						schools in the city with the objective of giving
						additional information regarding illegal drugs.
					</p>

					<p>
						 Baguio Schools Division Superintendent Dr. Federico
						 Martin said aside from additional information, they
						 hope students would not be victims of illegal drugs.
					</p>

					<p>
						 In particular, the city education division will
						 focus on students coming from the alternative
						 learning system who have not continued their 
						 education for them to be assisted in having a good 
						 education under the internal program on science and math.
					</p>

					<p>
						 "DepEd is planning to buy science related 
						 equipments this year funded by the City Government
						 for the use of the students under the ALS, aside from
						 the fast tracking of additional classrooms and school 
						 buildings as part of the K to 12 program of the government
						 ," Martin explained.
					</p>

					<p>
						 Martin pointed out additional trainings for teachers
						 will be done this year to ensure the quality of education
						 and academic performances of its students.
					</p>

					<p>
						Last year, Police Regional Office Cordillera regional
						director Chief Superintendent Elmo Francis Sarona started
						a partnership with the education sector to map out and
						help the schools come up with programs and probable
						curriculum on drug prevention.
